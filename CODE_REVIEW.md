# Brutal Code Review

This repository appears to be generated by a single prompt. Below is a critical assessment of its current state.

## High Level Concerns

1. **Generated Quality**
   - The code reads like an auto-generated dump with minimal consideration for clarity. There is a single massive TypeScript file (`index.ts`) that attempts to reimplement the entire WebSocket API, leading to complexity that is hard to maintain.
   - The tests (`src/index.test.ts`) are over 1,200 lines in one file, making them painful to navigate and maintain. They look like they were copy‑pasted with little structure or grouping.

2. **Design Issues**
   - `BetterWebSocket` inherits from `EventTarget` and implements `WebSocket`, but a number of standard fields are missing or partially implemented. The interface compliance is shaky at best.
   - Message queuing is implemented with a simple array and manual size calculations—no backpressure handling or bounded memory usage beyond a crude queue limit.
   - Connection management mixes concerns (timeouts, heartbeats, reconnection) in a single class with no separation of responsibility.

3. **Code Quality**
   - Many methods are overly long and attempt to handle every edge case inline, resulting in dense logic and poor readability.
   - Typing is superficial. `any` is sprinkled in tests, and the options interface does not enforce required values, which undermines type safety.
   - The `release.sh` script bundles building, publishing and pushing in one step without any checks, which is fragile and dangerous.

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - The integration tests spin up live WebSocket servers inside the test suite. This slows down the tests and introduces flakiness.
   - Assertions are repetitive and often just duplicates of previous tests with minor tweaks. Real unit tests would be cleaner and more focused.

5. **Project Hygiene**
   - There is no clear separation between source and distribution. The compiled output goes to `dist`, but the repository root is cluttered with scripts and configuration.
   - The `bun.lock` file is 600+ lines for a project with only a couple of dependencies.

Overall, the repository lacks polish and maintainability. A serious refactor would be needed before considering this production ready.
